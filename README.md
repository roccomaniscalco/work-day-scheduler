# Work Day Scheduler

Time management is a keystone component to any successful business day. Having an organized schedule allows you to focus on what needs to get done. The work day scheduler web app allows you to keep track of your daily tasks so you can stay on top of things.

Work Day Scheduler is powered by Jquery to dynamically generate html elements. The goal for this project was to minimize the use of static html. The reduction of html in favor of Jquery reduces code repetition which allows for changes to be easily implemented. On the other hand, this approach introduces dependencies and less readable code.
